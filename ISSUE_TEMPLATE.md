# Issues

We are transitioning to using JIRA for all bugs and support related issues, therefore the GitHub issues has been disabled.

If you find a mistake, bug, or any other helpful suggestion you'd like to make on the docs please head over to 
[Perfect JIRA](http://jira.perfect.org:8080/servicedesk/customer/portal/1) and raise it.

A comprehensive list of open issues can be found at [JIRA Open Issues](http://jira.perfect.org:8080/projects/ISS/issues)
